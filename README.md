Spring Boot Learning - Week 3
Overview
In Week 3, I focused on mastering data persistence and relationships in Spring Boot using JPA and Hibernate. This week, I also applied these concepts to build a Library Management Project.

Topics Covered
1. JPA & Hibernate
Introduction to JPA: Explored Java Persistence API (JPA) and how it simplifies database interactions in Spring Boot.
Hibernate ORM: Delved into Hibernate as the JPA implementation, understanding its role in managing database operations.
2. Entity Relationships
One-to-One Mapping: Implemented one-to-one relationships between entities, learning how to map these relationships in the database.
Many-to-One Mapping: Created many-to-one relationships to handle associations where multiple records in one table are associated with a single record in another.
Other Mappings: Explored other common entity mappings, such as one-to-many and many-to-many, understanding their use cases and implementation.
3. Sorting and Pagination
Sorting: Implemented sorting functionality in repositories to organize query results based on specific attributes.
Pagination: Learned how to paginate query results to efficiently manage large datasets in the application.
Library Management Project
During this week, I applied my learning by developing a Library Management System. This project involved:

Entity Creation: Defined entities like Book, Author and mapped relationships between them.
CRUD Operations: Implemented CRUD operations using JPA repositories to manage books, authors, and library members.
Sorting & Pagination: Added features to sort and paginate the list of books and members, enhancing the user experience.Spring data jpa , sorting pagination and mappings with home works
